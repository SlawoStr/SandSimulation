# SandSimulation

Each pixel is simulated and its behaviour depend on his neighborhood.

Controls:

Mouse left button - Spawn pixels of certain type

Num0 - Set type to Empty ( delete other cells )  
Num1 - Set type to Sand  
Num2 - Set type to Stone  
Num3 - Set type to Water  

( Bugged animation probably caused by drawing single pixels )
